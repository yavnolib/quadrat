## How can I use automatic test generation?
In "tests" folder you can see "parse_wolf.exe" app. 
This application generates random coefficients for the equation and parses the tungsten.com site to get solutions to this equation, then the application makes changes to the "test_generate.h" file and to the "tests_info.h" file, thus creating new tests. That is, to generate new tests, you just need to run the application.
